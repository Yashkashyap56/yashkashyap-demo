My journey started with pure curiosity about how technology actually works. Over time, I explored multiple domains — from Data Science and Machine Learning to Backend Development — and built projects that solve real problems.

<br>

I’ve actively participated in several Hackathons, including 5+ national-level events, and proudly secured a win at IEEE Hackathon for developing an AI-based smart safety system. Each hackathon taught me something new — teamwork, problem-solving, and how to think beyond the obvious.
<br>

Currently, I’m deep-diving into AI/ML and Predictive Analytics, learning how data can forecast, automate, and protect systems in the digital world. Alongside, I regularly practice DSA to sharpen my logic and coding skills — because for me, clean and optimized code is as important as creative ideas.
<br>
My goal is simple — to build intelligent, impactful systems that combine AI, data, and development to make technology more useful and secure.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me brainstorming new hackathon ideas, exploring new tools, or just learning something that pushes me a little further every day.
